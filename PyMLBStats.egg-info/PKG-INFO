        So there's not really a good documentation for the statsapi or really a good wrapper so I'm making once
        Right now i have the main get function and working on the paths
        
        # Working functions
        
        * `latestGamePack()`
        
        * `getAttendance()`
        
        * `getPlayer()`
        
        * `get()`

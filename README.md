# Install
Currently not working since I need to move all my code to init.py as well as work on the logistics
https://pypi.org/project/PyMLBStats/

# PyBaseball

This is a simple example package. You can use
[Github-flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
to write your content.

So there's not really a good documentation for the statsapi or really a good wrapper so I'm making once
Right now i have the main get function and working on the paths

# Working functions

* `latestGamePack()`

* `getAttendance()`

* `getPlayer()`

* ```get()
 get(path, dict_params):
    """Main get function that given a dictionary of inputs and a path will return the correct results
    Example:
    get("config", {'ver': 'v1', 'baseballStats': 'baseballStats'})""" ```
